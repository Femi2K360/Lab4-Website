             <p>Courses offered by the IS Department that are not part of the required BTA curriculum. Visit the Electives Page to view a complete list.</p>
             <b>Notes:</b>
             <p>Students must earn a grade of “C” or better for any course to be applied to the Information Systems major.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Before being allowed to take IS 410 and 450 (and then the rest of the IS 400-level core courses), a student must first complete the following gateway requirements:</p>
            <p>A grade of "C" or higher in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MATH 155 – Elementary Calculus and</li>
                <li>IS 147 – Introduction to Computer Programming</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And a grade of “B” or higher in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IS 300 – Management Information Systems and</li>
                <li>IS 310 – Software and Hardware Concepts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>IS 300 and IS 310 must be completed in residence and Information Systems does not support third time repeat petitions for the purposes of continuing in this major.</p>
            <p>Examples of upper-level electives that could be used to help fulfill the IS major requirements include: IS 303, IS 304, IS 460, IS 461, IS 427, IS 428, IS 430, IS 438, IS 464, IS 471, IS 472, IS 451U, IS 451M, and IS 452, as well as others (see catalog for a full listing).</p>
            <p>There are also several special courses, including IS 399, IS 478, IS 479, IS 469, IS 397, and IS 467, among others, that cannot be used to satisfy the IS upper-level elective requirement, but that students can use to gain academic credit for internships, coops, and research projects. See your advisor for more information.</p>
